# üì± Technical Challenge ‚Äì Staff Mobile Engineer

Welcome to the **Android Technical Challenge** repository. This exercise is part of the evaluation process for the **Staff Mobile Engineer** position.

## üéØ Challenge Objective

This project has been intentionally provided with several deficiencies in design, architecture, implementation, and best practices. The goal is to evaluate your **ability to identify, propose, and implement improvements** that enhance the technical quality of the codebase.

It's not just about making the project work, but about **thinking like a Staff Engineer**: making architectural decisions, prioritizing improvements, identifying risks, and delivering sustainable solutions.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time

The expected time to complete this challenge is approximately **5 hours**. We are not looking for a perfect solution, but rather evaluating your technical judgment and problem-solving approach.

## üìä Evaluation Topics

We will focus on the following aspects during the review:

- ‚úÖ **Modular Design**: Clear separation between layers and responsibilities, scalable structure.
- ‚úÖ **Design Patterns**: Proper usage of design patterns (e.g., MVVM, Coordinator, Strategy, etc.).
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Secure handling of tokens, session management, and authentication strategies.
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Injection Framework**: Appropriate use of DI frameworks to enable testing and decoupling.
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Robust handling of API errors and state errors.
- ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture** (also considering Hexagonal, Onion, VIPER, etc.).
- ‚úÖ **(Optional) Unit Testing**: Test coverage and code quality.
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring & Logging Strategy**: Mechanisms for logging and traceability.
- ‚úÖ **Feature Flags**: Ability to enable/disable features in a controlled manner.
- ‚úÖ **Best Practices**: Clean, maintainable, and idiomatic Java/Kotlin/Android code.
## üìÑ Expected Deliverables

1. **Updated codebase**, with the improvements applied.
2. A `Technical_Notes.md` file that includes:
  - Initial technical analysis
  - Key issues identified
  - Actions taken and technical rationale
  - Potential future improvements if more time were available
3. (Optional) A changelog or commits categorized by improvement type (e.g., Refactor, Fix, Enhancement, Docs, etc.).

## üì• Delivery Instructions

1. **Clone this repository locally**:
2. Work locally on the project and apply your improvements.
3. When you're done:
   * **Create a new repository in your personal GitHub account.**
   * Push your solution to that repository.
   * Share access with the person responsible for the hiring process.

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

- Ability to analyze and understand existing code.
- Technical approach and depth of decisions.
- Code clarity and organization.
- Proper use of design patterns and architectural principles.
- Improvements in maintainability, readability, and scalability.
- Documentation and communication of decisions.
- Alignment with the topics listed above.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional Notes

- You are not expected to fix every problem. A **well-reasoned and focused intervention** is more valuable than trying to cover everything superficially.
- If you add new dependencies, explain your technical rationale.
- You are free to change the project structure if needed.
- The project must remain functional after your improvements.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Make sure you have the following minimum setup:

- **Android Studio:** Android Studio Ladybug | 2024.2.1 Patch 3 or Higher

## Project Setup

To access to TheMovieDB API is necessary get a API KEY and access token:
* To register for an API key, click the [API link](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) from within your account settings page.

Just download the project and open `app/gradle` and replace the `MOVIE_API_KEY` with your key (the key that is already there does not work)

## üì© Questions or Help

If you have any questions or need clarification during the challenge, feel free to contact the person responsible for the hiring process.  
Please note that **we won‚Äôt provide technical hints or solutions**, but we‚Äôll be happy to assist with logistics or general clarifications.

## üé® Add Your Personal Touch & Enjoy the Challenge!

We want this challenge to also be an opportunity for you to show your technical style and creativity.  
Feel free to **add your personal touch**, demonstrate your engineering mindset, and most importantly, **have fun while working on this project**. üöÄ‚ú®
